The program reads "asci.txt" into a string that is used as a frame. then prints the string, waits a little using usecond, uses an ansi escape sequence to clear the frame,
and then reads the next frame.
the width and height of the frame (in characters) is defined at the beginning of the code (100 characters wide and 33 lines tall).
this was a fun project i worked on to learn how to read from files in c.
the release has an example asci.txt, and you can modify the source code to change the frame height and width.
